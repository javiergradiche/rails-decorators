# Rails::Decorators
Using [Rails engines](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) extensively, we needed a way to customize behavior for implementations of the platform. Rails provides a great mechanism for views and assets, but doesn't offer any functionality to handle controller/model/lib overriding/customizing. The suggested mechanism in the documentation is `class_eval` or ActiveSupport::Concern. Our preferred method for this is module prepending, which is cleaner than `class_eval` in that it avoids alias method chaining and becomes part of the ancestor chain.

We also want junior developers to be able to jump in and be productive ASAP - not necessarily requiring they learn the techniques of `class_eval` to fix a bug or get a simple task done. Yes, we educate and promote this as the developer grows, but we want the barriers to contribution as low as possible.

We like the [`ActiveSupport::Concern`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html) API, so this library mimics the API of `ActiveSupport::Concern` and layers on top some niceties for the specific task of customizing a Rails engine. Also, we don't like having to store decorated behavior in a separate directory (like https://github.com/parndt/decorators). Storing decorations in the same place as new classes makes it much easier to see the overall picture of how the engine has been customized/extended in one shot.

## Usage
Say we have a class in an engine like so:
```ruby
# in ecommerce/app/models/ecommerce/product.rb
module Ecommerce
  class Product < ApplicationRecord
    def price
      skus.first.price
    end
  end
end
```

`Rails::Decorators` allows customizing this class like so:
```ruby
# in Rails.root/app/models/ecommerce/product.decorator
module Ecommerce
  decorate Product do
    decorated do
      # Class methods may be called here. Evaluates after prepending module.
      attr_writer :on_sale
    end

    class_methods do
      # Methods defined here extend/decorate static methods on the
      # decorated class.
      def sorts
        super + ['discount_rate']
      end
    end

    # Methods defined here extend/decorate instance methods on the
    # decorated class.
    def price
      result = super
      result *= discount_rate if on_sale?
      result
    end
  end
end
```

`Rails::Decorators` achieves this in a manner similar to `ActiveSupport::Concern` - it dynamically creates a module out of the block passed, and then prepends that into the original class. The above is equivalent to (note that this would need to be required using `require_dependency` as well):
```ruby
# in Rails.root/app/models/ecommerce/product_decorator.rb
module Ecommerce
  class Product
    module Decorator
      module ClassMethods
        # Methods defined here extend/decorate static methods on the
        # decorated class.
        def sorts
          super + ['discount_rate']
        end
      end

      # Methods defined here extend/decorate instance methods on the
      # decorated class.
      def price
        result = super
        result *= discount_rate if on_sale?
        result
      end
    end
  end

  Product.send(:prepend, Product::Decorator)
  Product.singleton_class.send(:prepend, Product::Decorator::ClassMethods)
  Product.class_eval do
    # Class methods may be called here. Evaluates after prepending module.
    attr_writer :on_sale
  end
end
```

You can also decorate more than one class at a time:
```ruby
# in Rails.root/app/models/ecommerce/navigable.decorator
module Ecommerce
  decorate Product, Category, Page do
    def generate_slug
      # my custom logic here
    end
  end
end
```

When decorating modules and using the `decorated { }` block, you can opt
to decorate the "static" eigenclass of the module itself by passing
`static: true`

```ruby
# in Rails.root/app/models/ecommerce/commentable.decorator
module Ecommerce
  decorate Commentable do
    # This decorates the models that `Commentable` is included into.
    decorated do
      scope :with_comments, -> { where.not(comments: []) }
    end

    # This decorates the `Commentable` module's eigenclass.
    decorated static: true do
      mattr_accessor :config
      self.config = ActiveSupport::Configurable::Configuration.new
    end
  end
end
```

You can now call `Ecommerce::Commentable.config` as if it was defined on
the module's eigenclass, and the new `.with_comments` scope will be
added to all models that `include Ecommerce::Commentable`.

Other engines may want to namespace their customizations so as not to collide with further customizations:
```ruby
# in ecommerce_blog/app/models/ecommerce/product.decorator
module Ecommerce
  decorate Product, with: 'blog' do
    def blog_entries
      BlogEntry.for_product(id)
    end
  end
end
```

It is strongly suggested you update your editor of choice to use Ruby syntax highlighting on \*.decorator files.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails-decorators'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install rails-decorators
```
